This project is only a technical test to show some basic skills using Laravel PHP framework.

But... **your pull requests are always welcome!!!**. Knowledge needs to be shared.

```
Share your knowledge.
Itâ€™s a way to achieve immortality.

## Bootstrapping

### Homestead
First of all, be sure you have a local copy of the repository in your filesystem.

You can achieve that typing:

```Shell
$ git clone https://github.com/JordiTL/laravel-technical-test.git
$ cd laravel-technical-test
```

Then you have to create your local Homestead configuration file:

#### Linux
```Shell
$ php vendor/bin/homestead make
```

#### Windows
```Shell
$ vendor\bin\homestead make
```

Now you need to run the virtual machine via Vagrant:
```Shell
$ vagrant up
```

[Optional] Add your custom mapping to your hosts file

You can add it manually by appending the following lines to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
#The following line is added automatically to map Homestead host
[homestead-ip] homestead.app
```

Or adding it automatically running:

```Shell
$ printf "\n#The following line is added automatically to map Homestead host\n`grep -Po '(?<=ip: ").*(?=")' Homestead.yaml` homestead.app\n" | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
```


### Composer

Now you have to connect via ssh to your Homestead instance:

```Shell
$ vagrant ssh
```

And run inside it:

```Shell
$ cd [project-folder]
$ composer install
```

For example:

```Shell
$ cd /home/vagrant/Work/Laravel/laravel-technical-test/
$ composer install
```

### Migrations

We need to generate the database schema before we can use the app. But before that we need to generate an environment file:
```Shell
$ cp .env.example .env
$ php artisan key:generate
```

Then we need to create the database an users (feel free to change this settings in your production environment):
```Shell
$ mysql -uhomestead -psecret

mysql> CREATE DATABASE laraveltest;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON laraveltest.* TO 'laraveluser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'laravelpassword';
mysql> quit;
```

And then in project folder (inside homestead) run:
```Shell
$ php artisan migrate
```

If you want a default usertry:
```Shell
$ php artisan db:seed
```

- **email**: user@test.com
- **password**: password

### Gulp

The last step is to run Gulp to generate the public resources:
```Shell
$ gulp
```

And... you are done to test the app!

### Cron

The application has a built-in web scraper. It is configured to scrap the web hourly with the Laravel Scheduler.
The bad news are that Laravel Scheduler will only work if you add a cron to your system:

```Shell
$ crontab -e
```

And add the following line:
```cron
* * * * * php [artisan-executable] schedule:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
```

For example:
```cron
* * * * * php /home/vagrant/Work/Laravel/laravel-technical-test/artisan schedule:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Usage
This comes with a built-in commands. In the following sections you will see some of them.

### Scraper
#### Retrieval
This command will connect to http://www.appliancesdelivered.ie, download and store a collection of the ten cheapest products and the ten most expensive ones.

```Shell
$ php artisan scraper:retrieval
```

You can check all available commands by running:

```Shell
$ php artisan
```

## Git Flow

## Future work
Like all software projects, there is always a way to improve them. This is not an exception. The following lines will enumerate a few cool future features:

- Redis | Memcached | Hazelcast datagrid integration.
- Front-end improvements.
- Advanced scraping + crawling functionality.
- Advanced customization scraper options.
- Separate scraper to a custom project.
- Stripe payment API integration.
- E2E testing with PhantomJS
- ...

And maybe some crazy stuff:

- Realtime owner-customer chat
- Telegram (messaging app) sync with the chat
- Administrator capabilities to control [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)
